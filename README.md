# Story
**Make it super cool**

*I woke up early this Sunday because of a very good smell coming from outside of my bedroom. It was not coffee, but I could not resist to get up. I had that deep unknown feeling in my body though. Who the f was that guy yesterday ? I peeked outside. There he was, holding a ridiculously large pancake. I rubbed my eyes, either I was dreaming or this guy knew excatly what I wanted to eat*

*Friday arrived wrong.
I woke up with a feeling I didn’t invite and a memory that refused to focus.
The room was quiet, my head wasn’t.
One question stayed.
Who was that yesterday?*

*I peeked outside. There he was, holding a ridiculously large pancake. I rubbed my eyes, either I was dreaming or this guy knew excatly what I wanted to eat*

*"Hi", I said. He was smiling. "Can I have that?" I asked, pointing at the pancake.
"Sure", he replied. I walked and he raised his finger, "Can you answer a question first though?"*
